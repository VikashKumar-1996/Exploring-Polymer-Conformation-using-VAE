# Exploring-Polymer-Conformation-using-VAE
###  Objective
Explore the **structural diversity** and **latent space representations** of polymer chains using a VAE-based generative model.

###  Methodology
- Built VAE models in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.  
- Trained on **internal coordinates** of polymer chains.  
- Added **bond length constraints** and **self-avoidance penalties** for realistic geometry.  
- Generated and visualized conformations in **3D (PDB format)**.  
- Analyzed **end-to-end distance distributions** and **latent space interpolations**.
